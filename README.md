A set of extension methods that integrate the GrailSort algorithm into .NET collections and LINQ, providing high-performance, in-place sorting with flexible buffer strategies. Based on [Summer Dragonfly et al.'s Rewritten Grailsort for Java](https://github.com/HolyGrailSortProject/Rewritten-Grailsort). It has been retested and further optimized specifically for C#.

## Overview

This library provides extension methods for in-place sorting of arrays, lists, and LINQ queries using the GrailSort algorithm. GrailSort is a stable, efficient sorting algorithm that can operate with different buffer strategies:

* **Dynamic**: Allocates a temporary buffer at runtime.
* **Static**: Uses a pre-allocated internal buffer.
* **InPlace**: Performs the sort entirely in-place without extra memory.

The extensions wrap `GrailSort<T>` from `GrailSortCSharp.Algorithm` and expose familiar APIs similar to `Enumerable.OrderBy` and `List<T>.Sort`.

## What Is GrailSort?

GrailSort is a sophisticated variant of Merge Sort that achieves **stability**, **in-place sorting**, and **worst-case O(n log n)** performance. Unlike traditional Merge Sorts that require O(n) extra space, GrailSort cleverly utilizes the array itself to simulate buffer space, using a strategy based on collecting roughly **2 √ó ‚àön unique elements**.

The algorithm proceeds by:

1. **Collecting Unique Elements**: Attempts to gather 2 √ó ‚àön unique values at the front of the array. One half acts as a working buffer; the other half serves as keys to guide block merges.
2. **Buffered Merging**: Uses these elements to perform efficient merges of increasingly large subarrays.
3. **Block Merge Sort**: When the buffer becomes insufficient, the array is divided into ‚àön-sized blocks, which are reordered using tagged block swaps.
4. **Fallback Logic**: If there aren't enough unique keys, GrailSort reverts to in-place, rotation-based merge techniques that preserve stability and maintain O(n log n) performance.

This design allows GrailSort to fall back gracefully in degenerate scenarios while remaining fast and space-efficient.

## Why Choose GrailSort Over C# Built-In Sort?

C#'s built-in `Array.Sort` and `List<T>.Sort` methods use **Introspective Sort**, a hybrid of **QuickSort**, **HeapSort**, and **Insertion Sort**. While this is fast on average, it has limitations:

* ‚ùå **Not Stable**: Equal elements may not preserve their original order.
* ‚ùå **Not In-Place in Practice**: Sorting large reference-type arrays or custom comparers may cause temporary allocations.
* ‚ùå **Poor Worst-Case Behavior**: Although introspection kicks in to switch to HeapSort when recursion gets deep, it's still vulnerable to crafted worst-case QuickSort inputs.

**GrailSort** addresses these shortcomings:

* ‚úÖ **Stable**: Preserves the order of equal elements ‚Äî critical for sorting objects with composite keys.
* ‚úÖ **In-Place**: Fully supports in-place sorting (no heap allocations if `InPlace` buffer mode is selected).
* ‚úÖ **Worst-Case O(n log n)**: Performs consistently well even on adversarial input.
* ‚úÖ **Buffer-Configurable**: Lets you tune for memory vs. performance with `InPlace`, `Static`, or `Dynamic` strategies.
* ‚úÖ **High Customizability**: Works well with custom comparers, key selectors, and LINQ-style usage.

## Buffer Types

```csharp
public enum SortingBufferType
{
    InPlace,
    Static,
    Dynamic
}
```

### üîπ `InPlace`

Uses **no external buffer** (`buffer length = 0`).

  * Minimal memory overhead
  * Ideal for memory-constrained environments
  * Slightly slower
  * Relies on internal tricks (e.g., rotations and key-based swaps)

### üî∏ `Static`

Uses a **fixed-size buffer** of 512 elements (`GrailStaticExtBufferLen`).

  * Fixed memory usage
  * No repeated allocations for repeated sorts

### ‚ö° `Dynamic`

Allocates a buffer of size approximately **‚àön**, rounded up to the nearest power of 2 (`bufferLen¬≤ ‚â• length`).

  * Balances speed and memory usage
  * Scales well with various input sizes
  * Allocates a new buffer every sort
  * Still far less memory than algorithms like mergesort (O(‚àön) vs O(n))

  
## LINQ Extensions

### GrailOrderBy

```csharp
IEnumerable<TSource> GrailOrderBy<TSource, TKey>(
    this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
    Func<TSource, TKey> keySelector,
    IComparer<TKey>? comparer = null,
    SortingBufferType bufferType = SortingBufferType.Dynamic
)
```

Sorts an `IEnumerable<TSource>` by a key. Deferred execution: sorting occurs when the result is enumerated.

* `keySelector`: Projection function for sorting key.
* `comparer`: Key comparer (defaults to `Comparer<TKey>.Default`).
* `bufferType`: Chooses sorting buffer strategy.

### GrailOrderByDescending

```csharp
IEnumerable<TSource> GrailOrderByDescending<TSource, TKey>(
    this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
    Func<TSource, TKey> keySelector,
    IComparer<TKey>? comparer = null,
    SortingBufferType bufferType = SortingBufferType.Dynamic
)
```

Same as `GrailOrderBy`, but in descending order.

## Array\<T\> Extensions

```csharp
void GrailSort<T>(
    this T[] array,
    IComparer<T>? comparer = null,
    SortingBufferType bufferType = SortingBufferType.Dynamic
)

void GrailSort<T, TKey>(
    this T[] array,
    Func<T, TKey> keySelector,
    IComparer<TKey>? comparer = null,
    SortingBufferType bufferType = SortingBufferType.Dynamic
)
```

Sorts the array in-place. Overloads allow specifying a custom comparer or key selector.

## List\<T\> Extensions

```csharp
void GrailSort<T>(
    this List<T> list,
    IComparer<T>? comparer = null,
    SortingBufferType bufferType = SortingBufferType.Dynamic
)

void GrailSort<T, TKey>(
    this List<T> list,
    Func<T, TKey> keySelector,
    IComparer<TKey>? comparer = null,
    SortingBufferType bufferType = SortingBufferType.Dynamic
)
```

Sorts the `List<T>` in-place, with overloads similar to the array extensions.

## Examples
It can actually be used as a drop-in replacement for C# LINQ, Array.Sort<T>() and List<T>.Sort()
### Sorting an array of primitives

```csharp
int[] data = { 5, 3, 8, 1 };
data.GrailSort();              // Default dynamic buffer and natural order

data.GrailSort(SortingBufferType.InPlace); // In-place sorting
```

### Sorting with a key selector

```csharp
var people = new[] {
    new Person("Alice", 30),
    new Person("Bob", 25),
    new Person("Eve", 35)
};

people.GrailSort(p => p.Age); // Sort by Age
```

### Using LINQ-style GrailOrderBy

```csharp
var sortedNames = names
    .GrailOrderBy(name => name.Length)
    .ToList();

var sortedDesc = data
    .GrailOrderByDescending(x => x)
    .ToArray();
```

### Custom comparer and buffer strategy

```csharp
var comparer = Comparer<string>.Create((a, b) => a.CompareTo(b));
names.GrailSort(comparer, SortingBufferType.Static);
```
